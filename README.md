# Opera House Booking and Site navigation project.

## This project uses no classes, only REACT HOOKS with a Ruby on Rails back end.

## Getting started

In your terminal curl the following:

```
https://github.com/jeremyetzine/operahouse_server.git
```
```
https://github.com/BrendanShields/operahouse_client.git
```

open two instances of terminal and in the client run:

### `npm start`

in the server run:

### `npm start`

currently all the requests on the backend will be running through Heroku, to run
off the local host please replace all links beginning with https://operahouse-server.herokuapp.com/
to begin with with http://localhost:3000/

For instances where using local host within the terminal for the server run the following:

```
db:create; db:migrate; db:seed
```

## The future of this project

This project is still a work in progress. We will be adding Sign up functionality, expanding on the SVG map and creating a booking show page for users and tickets.
